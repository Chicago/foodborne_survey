================

A 2014 survey of Chicago residents regarding Foodborne Chicago  
  
This is a repository for documents concerning an email survey fielded by [SSI](http://www.surveysampling.com/) from December 11, 2014 to December 19, 2014 for Foodborne Chicago, with the help of the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/) and funding via a prototype fund grant by the [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/1/22/testable-moment-for-media-innovation/). There were 91 completed surveys.  
  
The final survey that was programmed is foodborne_chicago_final_survey.docx. The results files from SSI are the two excel files, 653001_Final_Excel_121914.xlsx and 653001_Final_Frequency_121914.xls  
  
I've included a file called 653001_Final_Excel_121914_xlsx.Rdata that is an Rdata representation of the data that includes question labels and other goodies to aid in easier analysis.
  
An analysis of the completed surveys will be included eventually...
