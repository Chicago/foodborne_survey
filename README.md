================

A 2014 survey of Chicago residents regarding Foodborne Chicago  
  
This is a repository for documents concerning an email survey fielded by [SSI](http://www.surveysampling.com/) from December 11, 2014 to December 19, 2014 for Foodborne Chicago, with the help of the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/) and funding via a prototype fund grant by the [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/1/22/testable-moment-for-media-innovation/). There were 91 completed surveys.  
  
The final survey that was programmed is foodborne_chicago_final_survey.docx. The results files from SSI are the two excel files, 653001_Final_Excel_121914.xlsx and 653001_Final_Frequency_121914.xls 
  
An analysis of the completed surveys will be included eventually...
